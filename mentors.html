                <p>Chillennium is at its heart a learning experience, and what better way to learn how to make games than from the awesome people that do it for a living?</p>
                <p>Mentors will be on the jam floor actively participating in the game creation process with attendees. Mentors will not be allowed to actually create content for the games or participate in the judging process. However, they will be with participants throughout the weekend to share their knowledge and experience, answer questions, and offer their advice on techniques and designs.</p>
                <p>Mentors will also be provided meals, snacks, and on-site resting areas, so if you are interested in mentoring, please don't hesitate to <a href="https://forms.gle/u9pNfkNGBcG9U2d2A">apply</a>! Though do note that Chillennium is not able to provide hotel accommodations, so please plan accordingly.</p>
                <br><p>Check out some of the amazing mentors who will provide their expertise at Chillennium 2019!</p>

I worked in game development for the past three years, working at LIVE Lab as its Producer and at Redbird Learning as a Senior Project Manager before falling in love with software consulting. I led the Texas A&amp;M Game Developers (TAGD) organization as its president for two years and also served as Chillennium's PR chair in 2017. I currently work at Capco as a software consultant, solving business problems using software solutions - which essentially means I'm a glorified problem solver with a knack for design, development, and organizing chaos.
