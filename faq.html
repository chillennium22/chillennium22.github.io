        <h4>How do I enter the jam?</h4>
        <p>Follow us on social media to learn how and when to sign up!</p>
        <h4>When and where is the jam?</h4>
        <p>Date and Location to be announced.</p>
        <h4>Can I use a game I have been working on?</h4>
        <p>
          All game code and content must be created during the 48-hour game jam
          period. Though we do not expect all game jam contest submissions to be
          entirely created from scratch, we prohibit creating game content prior
          to the start of the competition. If you choose to adapt code or
          content from the internet, be sure to make it your own. Derivative
          work will be recognized by the judges and may affect your game's
          score.
        </p>
        <h4>What can I use to make my game?</h4>
        <p>
          Participants will be required to bring their own computing equipment,
          laptops, desktops, monitors, etc. We recommend bringing any
          peripherals (tablet, Oculus Rift, Kinect, Wii Remotes, controllers,
          etc.) you may need. Power drops and wireless internet access will be
          provided, though wired ethernet is not guaranteed. Volunteer staff
          will be available to help participants load/unload and set up their
          equipment upon request.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants will be allowed to use any programming languages or
          software available to them (e.g. Unity, Unreal Engine, Maya, Houdini,
          the Adobe Creative Suite). It is primarily up to the participants to
          bring what they think they'll need to build a game in 48 hours.
        </p>
        <h4>How are games judged?</h4>
        <p>
          Games will be judged by a team of industry professionals, sponsors,
          and children (10+). Judging will begin immediately following the game
          jam's ending. Games will be ranked on a scale from 0 to 5 for their
          Innovation, Quality, and Completeness in the categories of
          Programming, Art, Design, and Sound for a total maximum score of 60.
          The three teams with the highest overall scores will be awarded the
          1st, 2nd, and 3rd place for Best Overall Game. Additional prizes will
          be awarded to the teams with the highest individual scores in
          Programming, Art, Design, and Sound. To encourage innovation, there is
          also an award for VR. Games cannot win more than one award.
        </p>
        <h4>Where can I play the games?</h4>
