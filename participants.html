        <h1>What is Chillennium?</h1>
        <p>
          Chillennium is the largest student-run game jam in the world,
          organized by students, for students. Hosted annually by the Department
          of Visualization, Chillennium is founded, staffed, and organized by
          students of Texas A&amp;M University. This unique event brings
          participants from around the globe to meet fellow game enthusiasts,
          develop their skills, and compete for prizes. Those who participate
          can compete alone or as a team of up to 4 and will have 48 hours to
          plan, design, and develop a video game from scratch based on a theme!
          During the jam, mentors from the game industry will be walking the
          floors helping participants develop their ideas into amazing games. At
          the end of the 48 hours, the games will be played and judged by a
          panel of experts from the game industry and winners will be awarded
          prizes! No previous knowledge about games is needed, just a passion
          for creation!

        /></a>
        <h4>What to Bring</h4>
        <p>
          Participants will be required to bring a valid ID. You are also
          responsible for bringing your own computing equipment and any
          peripherals. Participants will be fed 3 meals a day and free snacks
          are provided, but you are also allowed to bring your own food and
          snacks if you would like. If you wish to take advantage of our rest
          areas, you should bring your own pillows, blankets, etc.; similarly,
          you'll need to provide your own toiletries for when you shower.
        </p>
        <h4>Equipment</h4>
        <p>
          Participants will be required to bring their own computing equipment,
          laptops, desktops, monitors, etc. We recommend bringing an ethernet
          cable with you and any other peripherals (tablet, Oculus Rift, Kinect,
          Wii remotes, controllers, etc.) you may need. Power drops and wireless
          internet access will be provided. There will be no wired internet at
          the game jam venue; if participants need access to the internet they
          will need to bring a wireless device. Volunteer staff will be
          available to help participants load, unload, and set up their
          equipment upon request.
        </p>
        <h4>Contest Judging</h4>
        <p>
          Games will be judged by a team of industry professionals, sponsors,
          and children (age 10+). Games will be ranked on a scale from 0 to 5
          for their Innovation, Quality, and Completeness in the categories of
          Programming, Art, Design, and Sound for a total maximum score of 60.
          The three teams with the highest overall scores will be awarded the
          1st, 2nd, and 3rd place for Best Overall Game. Additional prizes will
          be awarded to exceptional teams in each category of Programming, Art,
          Design, and Sound. In the spirit of friendly competition, teams will
          not be able to receive multiple awards.
        </p>
        <h4>Code &amp; Content</h4>
        <p>
          All game code and content must be created during the 48-hour game jam
          period. Though we do not expect all game jam contest submissions to be
          created entirely from scratch, Chillennium prohibits creating game
          content prior to the start of competition. If you choose to adapt code
          or content from the internet, be sure that you make it your own.
          Derivative work will be recognized by judges and will affect your
          game's score.
        </p>
        <h4>Food &amp; Rest</h4>
        <p>
          Game jam participants will be provided breakfast, lunch, and dinner
          and have access to snacks and drinks for the duration of the event.
          Meals will be served outside the Game Jam work zone in the dining
          area, but free snacks will be available in the work zone. You can
          still bring your own food or drinks if you want. If you have any food
          allergies or preferences, please specify this during registration. No
          alcohol is allowed at the game jam, and it will be confiscated by
          Chillennium security.
        </p>
        <p>
          If participants wish to take a break, there will be a staffed rest
          area reserved for Chillennium; participants should bring their own
          pillows and blankets.
        </p>
        <h4>Security</h4>
        <p>
          Participants must be currently enrolled college or university
          students. Participants will be issued an official Chillennium badge to
          wear for the duration of the event. Though it is advised that
          participants stay on site for the duration of the Game Jam,
          participants will be allowed to exit the venue. Re-admittance will
          only be granted to those wearing an official Chillennium badge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visitors are allowed onto the jam floor, though they must check in
          with Chillennium security at the front desk to receive a guest pass
          and are only allowed to stay for an hour. Visitors will only be
          allowed between 10:00 am and 10:00 pm, and are not entitled to any
