                <p>
                    Register <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://tamu.estore.flywire.com/visualization/chillennium-registration---annual-game-jam-17002__;!!KwNVnqRv!QDef9UI4d7oba0YTAgFGzNxOhZNcj0ZRGW9HIxSqbekS-oXo_LibgpiLBg4qpHX7P85C2sM$">here</a>!
                </p>
                <h4>When and where is the jam?</h4>
                <p>February 24th to 26th at the Hildebran Equestrian Center</p>
                <h4>Can I use a game I have been working on?</h4>
                <p>
                    All game code and content must be created during the 48-hour
                    game jam period. Though we do not expect all game jam
                    contest submissions to be entirely created from scratch, we
                    prohibit creating game content prior to the start of the
                    competition. If you choose to adapt code or content from the
                    internet, be sure to make it your own. Derivative work will
                    be recognized by the judges and may affect your game's
                    score.
                </p>
                <h4>What can I use to make my game?</h4>
                <p>
                    Participants will be required to bring their own computing
                    equipment, laptops, desktops, monitors, etc. We recommend
                    bringing any peripherals (tablet, Oculus Rift, Kinect, Wii
                    Remotes, controllers, etc.) you may need. Power drops and
                    wireless internet access will be provided, though wired
                    ethernet is not guaranteed. Volunteer staff will be
                    available to help participants load/unload and set up their
                    equipment upon request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Participants will be allowed to use any programming
                    languages or software available to them (e.g. Unity, Unreal
                    Engine, Maya, Houdini, the Adobe Creative Suite). It is
                    primarily up to the participants to bring what they think
                    they'll need to build a game in 48 hours.
                </p>
                <h4>How are games judged?</h4>
                <p>
                    Games will be judged by a team of industry professionals and
                    sponsors ( Click <a href="judges.html">here</a> to see Chillenium 2022 Judges). Judging will begin immediately
                    following the game jam's ending. Games will be ranked on a
                    scale from 0 to 5 for their Innovation, Quality, and
                    Completeness in the categories of Programming, Art, Design,
                    and Sound for a total maximum score of 60. The three teams
                    with the highest overall scores will be awarded the 1st,
                    2nd, and 3rd place for Best Overall Game. Additional prizes
                    will be awarded to the teams with the highest individual
                    scores in Programming, Art, Design, and Sound. To encourage
                    innovation, there is also an award for VR. Games cannot win
                    more than one award.
